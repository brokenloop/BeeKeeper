This includes running our website, helping us organise awareness campaigns, and coordinating petitions against the use of pesticides.

            <h1>Start a hive</h1>
            <p>If you or someone you know is interested in starting an apiary on your property, we can arrange to have the necessary materials sent to you! As long as you provide a safe environment for the bees to live, they will provide you with a constant supply of honey. All we ask is that you send us regular honey samples for scientific analysis. The rest of the honey is yours to keep! That's a pretty sweet deal.</p>

            <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p>BeeKeeper is an organisation that advocates for public awareness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder">Colony Collapse Disorder</a>, and the preservation of the wild honeybee. Through the combined efforts of commercial apiarists, farmers, environmental scientists, and home beekeepers, we hope to mitigate the harmful effects that pesticides are having on wild honeybee colonies, and ultimately preserve one of the cornerstones of our natural ecosystem.</p>
