            <h1 class="h1">Colony Collapse Disorder</h1>
            <p>Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is an unexplained phenomenon whereby worker bees in a beehive spontaneously disappear. This phenomenon is currently poorly understood, but it stands to have devastating effects if left unchecked. The video below explains our current understanding of colony collapse disorder, and some of its potential consequences.</p>

            <h1>What this means for humans</h1>
            <p>If colony collapse disorder continues unchecked, the consequences could be dire. Some of the consequences are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="listhead">Food Shortages</li>
                        <li class="listcontent">Honeybees provide pollination for the majority of plants consumed by humans. If the honeybee population collapses, we would see a drastic decrease in the amount and variety of food available to us.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="listhead">Economic Loss</li>
                        <li class="listcontent">Around <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS">one fifth</a> of the world's population rely on agriculture as a source of income. Without a reliable source of pollination, we can expect the majority of these jobs to disappear.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="listhead">Environmental Impact</li>
                        <li class="listcontent">Bees play a vital role in the ecosystem. If they were to go extinct, the effects could stretch far wider than the food chain. A huge portion of birds and other animals depend on bees for nutrition. Without them, there's no telling what other species might go extinct.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li class="listcontent">With a sudden decrease in employment and a drastic increase in food scarcity, most countries would experience significant social unrest.</li>

            <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p>BeeKeeper is an organisation that advocates for public awareness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder">Colony Collapse Disorder</a>, and the preservation of the wild honeybee. Through the combined efforts of commercial apiarists, farmers, environmental scientists, and home beekeepers, we hope to mitigate the harmful effects that pesticides are having on wild honeybee colonies, and ultimately preserve one of the cornerstones of our natural ecosystem.</p>
